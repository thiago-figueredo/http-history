The WorldWideWeb (WWW) project aims to allow links to be made to any  
information anywhere. The address format includes an access method  
(=namespace), and for most name spaces a hostname and some sort of path.

We have a prototype hypertext editor for the NeXT, and a browser for line mode  
terminals which runs on almost anything. These can access files either locally,  
NFS mounted, or via anonymous FTP. They can also go out using a simple protocol  
(HTTP) to a server which interprets some other data and returns equivalent  
hypertext files. For example, we have a server running on our mainframe  
(http://cernvm.cern.ch/FIND in WWW syntax) which makes all the CERN computer  
center documentation available. The HTTP protocol allows for a keyword search  
on an index, which generates a list of matching documents as annother virtual  
hypertext document.

If you're interested in using the code, mail me.  It's very prototype, but  
available by anonymous FTP from info.cern.ch. It's copyright CERN but free  
distribution and use is not normally a problem.

The NeXTstep editor can also browse news. If you are using it to read this,  
then click on this: <http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html> to find  
out more about the project. We haven't put the news access into the line mode  
browser yet.

We also have code for a hypertext server. You can use this to make files  
available (like anonymous FTP but faster because it only uses one connection).  
You can also hack it to take a hypertext address and generate a virtual  
hypertext document from any other data you have - database, live data etc. It's  
just a question of generating plain text or SGML (ugh! but standard) mark-up on  
the fly. The browsers then parse it on the fly. 

The WWW project was started to allow high energy physicists to share data,  
news, and documentation. We are very interested in spreading the web to other  
areas, and having gateway servers for other data.  Collaborators welcome! I'll  
post a short summary as a separate article.
